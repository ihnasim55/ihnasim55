Md. Ismail Hossain Nasim 😊

    - Hi, I’m Md. Ismail Hossain Nasim, a mechanical engineering student from Dhaka, Bangladesh. I have a passion for designing 🛠️, simulating 🖥️, and prototyping mechanical systems using Solidworks, Ansys, and Arduino. I have a CSWA certification 🏅 and I have completed many projects using these tools. I have also earned LinkedIn certifications on C and Solidworks.

Skills and Expertise 💪

        -Solidworks modeling and simulation 📐
        -Ansys finite element analysis and optimization 🔍
        -Arduino programming and circuit design 🔌
        -C and Python programming languages 💻
        -3D printing and fabrication 🖨️
        
Projects and Portfolio 📁 

Here are some of the projects that I have worked on using my skills and expertise:
    
        -Arduino Based CNC Writing Robot 🤖✍:
                An Arduino-based CNC writing robot is a device that can draw or write on a flat surface using a pen or a marker. It is controlled by an Arduino microcontroller, which sends commands to the stepper motors that move the pen along the X and Y axes. The pen can also be lifted or lowered by a servo motor on the Z axis. The CNC writing robot can create various shapes, patterns, texts, or even artworks by following a set of instructions or a vector image file.
        -Quadruped spider robot 🕷🕸: 
                A quadruped spider robot is a four-legged robot that mimics the movement and behavior of spiders. It uses servo motors to control the joints of each leg, and an Arduino microcontroller to coordinate the motion and balance of the robot. It can walk, run, climb, and perform various poses by following a set of instructions or a vector image file.
        -Curved baffle Shell and Tube Heat Exchanger Design, modeling, simulation and made it physically 🥵⇆🥶.
        -Lithium battery modeling and Thermal analysis simulation 🔋.
        -Lithium battery cooling with PCM material simulation 🌬🔋.
        -Kinematics design and simulation 🛠🔧🔩⚙.
